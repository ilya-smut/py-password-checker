## What is a strong password? ##
A strong password should be at least eight characters long and include a mix of upper- and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols. It is also essential to choose a password that is not easily guessed, such as a name, birth date, or address. A strong password should not be reused on other accounts. - https://iso-docs.com/blogs/iso-27001-isms/password-policy (ISO27001)
